# Graph-Neural-Network-Model-for-Protein-Complex

The script generates protein graphs based on pairwise interaction energy from PDB files, where each amino acid is represented as a node with encoded features such as amino acid type (using ProtBert language model) , chain ID, and evolutionary relationship. The edge weights between nodes are based on pairwise interaction energies calculated using NAMD and Grinn.
